Its prevention of dynamic code attachment in smart contracts notably blocks reentrancy attacks providing safety to both users and developers.
* Robust Asset Protection: SUI’s strong object ownership and typing systems eliminate risks such as double spending, ensuring your assets are always secure and not locked in smart contracts.

### Fast

* Lightning-fast Transactions: Leverage the speed of SUI’s "Fast Path" technology, which avoids bottlenecks, enabling quick asset transfers.
* Efficient Transaction Processing: SUI’s parallel transaction processing ensures high performance, keeping the network responsive even during peak times.

### User Friendly

* Revolutionary Access Control: Eliminate the complexity of private keys. With SUI, access your wallet using familiar social logins such as gmail or twitch, enhancing convenience for all users.
* Low Gas Fees: SUI keeps transaction costs down by allowing the grouping of multiple transactions into a single call. Daily gas fee voting maintains balance ensuring fees are neither too high nor too low.
